# Web Dev Challenge: It’s All Connected

> Sponsored by [Intuit Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), hosted in partnership with [RenderATL](https://www.renderatl.com/).

## The Challenge

> Come up with ways to connect people’s behavior to e-commerce incentives.

Creating brand loyalty is everything to an e-commerce store. Our friends at Blvck Spades have a great product, and they need help coming up with ways to incentivize users to interact with their brand.

Your challenge is to build software that connects a user’s activity to incentives. Beyond an e-commerce store, many businesses might have an app, partnerships, or physical locations or events — our job is to connect a user’s activity in these other places to incentives in the e-commerce store using the Mailchimp users as the source of truth.

For example, something like “play 10 rounds of our game and get 10% off your order in the store”, or “show up to a local meetup and earn an exclusive, limited edition t-shirt”.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You *do not* have to build the full e-commerce store part of this! In fact, it’s probably not possible given the time constraint. Instead, focus on building the fun interaction thing and making the note in Mailchimp that the user has done the thing that earns the incentive.

> [!TIP]
> 💜 **A note about the prompt:**
> 
> The prompt is here to create constraints and give us a general theme. **Creative (mis)interpretations of the prompt are not only allowed — they’re actively encouraged!**
> 
> We’re trying to have fun, make each other laugh, learn something new, and get people stoked to build on the web. **The more fun you’re having, the better this goes for everyone.**
> 
> The best case for all of us is to approach this as a playful opportunity to build something we enjoy, whether it’s cool/clever, useful, or an intentional trolling effort.

## The Tool: Mailchimp

**Your app must use Mailchimp as part of the build.**

Mailchimp’s APIs allow us to update a given user’s record to include additional metadata. In this challenge, use [Mailchimp’s members API](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/list-members/) as the source of truth for storing user activity and incentives. The `tags` property on each member is probably your best bet for accomplishing this.

## Data from Blvck Spades

We're teaming up with Blvck Spades to provide you with real products for use in your builds. Feel free to use some or all of the products in [the JSON file](blvck-spades-products.json) as part of your build — or none of them, if you have a different idea.

## Your Advisor

We will have an advisor on site with us from Mailchimp to answer questions and help make sure we all get great results. In addition, Jason will be there to help out.
